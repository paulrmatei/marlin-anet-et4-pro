# Configurations in this folder

On a first stage of this project, I uploaded user tested configurations for the different ET4 series models to try to achieve a "common" configuration which worked for any ET model, aside of the ET models specific hardware details. 

Now, [Easyconfig](https://github.com/davidtgbe/Marlin/blob/bugfix-2.0.x/Marlin/EasyConfig.h) is the best option to start with, and, these files, are only here to consult.

- User configurations are not tested by me, as I only have the "regular" ET4 printer. 
- This user configurations are **not update/mantained**.
- **Copying / pasting these files wont't work**. You can use these files as a template, but you have to create your own configuration files to ensure that you have the correct settings for your printer or use [Easyconfig](https://github.com/davidtgbe/Marlin/blob/bugfix-2.0.x/Marlin/EasyConfig.h). You can use a side to side comparision software like [Winmerge](https://winmerge.org/) to do this job.
- Check also the [configuration.h](https://github.com/davidtgbe/Marlin/blob/ff35907c14c2814c4b7ea4a3c3df2c3da98937ab/Marlin/Configuration.h#L38) and [configuration_adv.h](https://github.com/davidtgbe/Marlin/blob/ff35907c14c2814c4b7ea4a3c3df2c3da98937ab/Marlin/Configuration_adv.h#L33) version. 

Marlin configurations for specific machines are now maintained in their own repository at:

## https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/bugfix-2.0.x

Configuration files for use with the nightly `bugfix-2.0.x` branch can be downloaded from:
